# weather

Working with an API in this one. Heavily following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InoAIgBZIEA

The only difference being that I'm not going to use JQuery and instead stick with regular ol' js. Yes, it's not as fast and simple etc etc, but learning it the longer way really helps me understand everything that's going on. Etc. For example, knowing what's calling the server and such seems to be important to understand.

- HTML: mostly fine. i had some issue getting stuff in js to work with classes so i ended up switching them to ids instead.
- CSS: didn't do too much of that.
- JS: i called an API and then used it! woo! the tutorial was pretty straight forward. it wasn't that bad either when i tried to find pure js ways to do things instead of using JQuery.

Overall, this project wasn't bad at all. I guess I was just following a tutorial, but still. Sometimes tutorials can be out of date and stuff gets fuzzy like that. Also, deviating from a tutorial can complicate things. I don't have any specific ideas on what to do with a weather api, but I felt like it would have been the easiest to figure out at the moment. Then I found the tutorial and yah. So productive. 12/4/18.
