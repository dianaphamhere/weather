Working with an API in this one. Heavily following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InoAIgBZIEA

The only difference being that I'm not going to use JQuery and instead stick with regular ol' js.

For example, knowing what's calling the server and such seems to be important to understand.
